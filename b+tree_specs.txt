b tree creation function:
- storage manager is passed on creation - assume index manager can 
  decide where the b tree should be writing to on disk. 

- root node - what does an empty tree look like in memory and on disk?
            - leaf node with no filled in values. 
            - root node is just a pointer to a node, not the node 
              itself (we can assume that index manager can pass root
              node as metadata on startup).
